Some people believe that famous sports people are paid too much money, wheras others think famous sports people are not paid too much money. I personally believe famous people are not paid too much money.

Firstly, famous sports people provide us with huge entertainment. We will always cheer them on in front of the TV screen, and we will hoot and hollar. All of this are their doing to make us excited.

Secondly, famous sports people work very hard. They will train for years and years just for a prize at a competition. We can use a frase to describe them. "For one minute on stage, for ten years to train under stage." So they are living a hard life.

And moreover, the famous sports people can teach us things we need to know in our lifetime, such as "No pains no gains".

To sum up, famous sports people are not paid to much money.
