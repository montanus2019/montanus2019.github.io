Fellow students, parents, how are you today? (Answer) I hope the Weather is well for travelling.  (Yes. / No.)  Today I want to talk about how to choose friends. (oh. /Wow. /Uh? )

It is very hard to find a true friend. I, myself, had some difficulty finding my real friend. You must not be blinded by some of offers, you must think about the advantages and disadvantages. I had once chosen the wrong friend, which caused me pain in life and even now I haven't walked out of the shadows. ( Oh … )

But I’m not saying you can't trust or make any friends. I’m just saying you must be careful choosing them. Is everything clear? (Answer.)

How can you choose? Here are some tips from me which you could use:

1. Observe the behavior of them.

2. Observe a long time to see if his/her attitude towards you.

3. Consider his/her place of sociality.

I hope you are having a good day. Best Wishes to you all. Thank you for listening!
(Applaud)
