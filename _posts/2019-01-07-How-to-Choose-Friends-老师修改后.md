Fellow students, parents, how are you today? (Answer) I hope the weather is  ~~well~~   **good**  for travelling.  (Yes. / No.)  Today I want to talk about how to choose friends. (Oh. /Wow. /Uh? )

It is very hard to find a true friend. I, myself, had some difficulty finding my real friend. You must not be blinded by some  ~~of~~  offers,  **and**  you must think about the advantages and disadvantages. I had once chosen the wrong friend, which caused me pain in  **my**  life, and even now I haven't walked out of the shadows. ( Oh … )

But I’m not saying you can't trust or make any friends. I’m just saying you must be careful choosing them. Is everything clear? (Answer.)

 **So** , how can you choose? Here are some tips from me which you could use:

1. Observe the behavior of 
them.

2. Observe  **them for** a 
long time to see if his/her attitude towards you.

3. Consider his/her  ~~place~~  **behaviour**   ~~of~~   **in**  sociality  **social situations.** 

I hope you are having a good day. Best wishes to you all. Thank you for listening!

 **Teacher’s comments:**  

- Wow, great job, Pluvia. This is a really good speech. The organisation is great, and I really like the sentence, “even now I haven't walked out of the shadows”. That is a fantastic description of your difficult situation.

- The difference between ‘well’ and ‘good’.

- - ‘Well’ describes a verb;
> “She sings very well.”

- - ‘Good’ describes a noun;
> “The weather was very good today.”
