Many people say that the private lives of famous people should be made public, however others say the private lives of famous people should not be made public and I personally agree with this opinion.

Firstly, I couldn't hide the fact that the public have great interest in famous people. They are always asking for an autograph or wanting to take a photo of the famous people they meet. Normal people would think this a honor, but the people who are famous don't think so, they fell uneasy under this circumstance. The same with their private lives.

Secondly, famous people are role models for us. Any one would want to be like them, and they want to learn from the famous people. They are like, heros, to us normal people. So they don't always want to say their real identity.

To sum up, the private lives of famous people should not be made public, I think.
