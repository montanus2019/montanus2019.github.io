*The Wind in the Willows* is about the delightful adventure of four friends, Badger, Rat, Mole and Toad. The setting is in the countryside. I personally believe the four main characters all have their own characteristics and represent different stages of life. Badger, the eldest, has a strict and kind nature. Rat, next to Badger, is hospitable and understanding, like Badger, but sometimes he has an adventurous nature like a young man. Mole, who represents a young man, is often wanting to act grown up, but when there are important choices, he must relies on others. Toad, the youngest, usually is a foolish child, the others all have to help him to get along with life. 

Also in this book, I'd like to say that there is mentorship in it. Rat is a successful teacher to Mole. We can make a contrast from the "Mole before" and the "Mole after". You can see he is brave enough to be himself. And Badger teaches Toad successfully too. Because at the end of the book, Toad is acting like a real gentleman. 

I really recommend this book to read.
