Dear Sir,

I notice this advertisement in the online magazine Global Food yesterday, and I think I might be suitable for the job as a Restaurant reviewer.

I have a tood taste with the restaurant's view, so my pictures are the best. My photos are excellent in the light and I have learnt from a famous photographer how to beautify the photographs that I have taken.

And also I am really interested in and memorize the different types of food qround the globe. Recently, I have been training to be a brilliant gastrologist. And I already love tasting food and estimate them. The evaluation I make is the most real.

Moreover, the level of English I have is great. I can use English to speak to foreigners and I am very familiar with the dollars they use. My English is perfect.

I hope you can give this job to me, thank you.

Yours sincerely,

X-woman
