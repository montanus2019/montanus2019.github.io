A rusted car drove noisily up the street in front of an old fashioned apartment. The driver side door is hanging on its edges. A person got out, he is skinny and black, he worn glasses too. He walked up to the door and tried to open it, no luck, the person cursed, than he shouted with all his strength: "Armpit!"

A huge black guy wearing only patched up pajamas appeared at the door, he said sleepily: " Hey X-ray! Man, you are early." X-ray smiled: "I wouldn't have been early if you are not my best friend!" X-ray and Armpit have known each at camp green lake, "So, you are going to dine out with your girl friend and me?" "Zzzzz..." "Armpit dude!" "Oh! What? Yeah, we are going to a place called China town." Armpit yawned and said, on the verge of sleeping, " Oh, man! you can come in a moment. If you don't mind, I am having a pillow lust at the moment." With these words, he went up the creaking staircase and closed the door.

" Well, I think I should take a nap too. Zzzz......"
