### Scene 1
 **Setting** : The front door of Lily’s house. 

*(Lily comes out of the door.)*

 **Lily** : Oh, who sent this lovely card? (Open the card.) How strange! A frog’s concert at tomorrow 8:00 in the evening. Well, I think I should go…

### Scene 2
 **Setting** : The pond. 

*(Lily finds herself becoming smaller.)*

 **Lily** : How can I be so small?

 **Frog①** : Welcome to our music concert! 

 **Lily** : Who, who… Are you? Or what?

 **Frog①** : I’m the pianist. And this is the violinist, this is the singer.

 **Frog ②&③** : Hello, welcome!

 **Lily** : Thank you.

 **Frog ②** : Ok, let’s begin!

*(They started playing)*

.               .                .

 **Lily** : How wonderful! I must go home now, it’s very late. I must have dinner.

 **Frog ③** : Please, Miss, would you like to stay and dine with us?

*(All three frogs look eagerly at Lily.)*

 **Lily** : Um…Ok! I would be honored!

 **Frog ①②③** : Hooray!

### Scene 3
 **Setting** : A leaf.

*(They are having dinner.)*

 **Lily** : Thank you so much, but I must go now. Goodbye!

 **Frog ①②③** : Goodbye! We will invite you again! We promise!

*But Lily never saw them 
again. She is very, very old 
now, but she still remembers that night, and hopes to pass it on.* **One generation after another, to let all children hear this story.**
