 **Hi Alex** ,

Thanks so much for your letter! It’ll be great for you to come here.

If you want some sightseeing, I could give you a tour around Zhong Shan Grave. It’s so beautiful in summer. We could also climb the Mount ZiJin. It’s a great view at the top. You could also eat and shop in Fuzi Temple. I like the stinky tofu. Smells very stinky, but it’s actually quite yummy.

If you want me come and play with you, I suggest we can meet at Nanjing New Street Bus Stop. If you don’t know where it is, ask me for directions. When will we meet, Alex? I think we could make it up on the phone. Any time is fine for me.

Oh Alex, I’m making plans for visiting your country, and can you tell me where I’d like to go? I’ll always be glad if you come.

Sorry, my mom’s calling me to dinner now. Bye! Talk soon, miss you!

Best wishes,

 **Julie**
