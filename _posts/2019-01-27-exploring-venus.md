** Exploring Venus**


Do you know? Venus is the planet that is closest in size compared to Earth. But it is not at all like Earth. Who would know that Venus is both beauty and beast?

Venus is the brightest ‘star’ in our night sky. People have admired this dazzling point of light from the beginning of humans.
Venus is a bizarre world that is part beauty and part beast. Venus is an extremely hostile place——Maybe even hotter the hottest place on Mercury! It also has towering mountains, vast plains, gigantic volcanoes, deep craters, and many other amazing features for use to see.

What is the green house effect? Venus has huge clouds that trap heat and make Venus’ average temperature about 870℉! The clouds that trap heat are Venus’ atmosphere. It is made out of large amounts of carbon dioxide, which is very efficient in trapping heat.

Layers of air can be very heavy, just as large amounts of sand. The air on Venus is so weighty that if you were able to stand on its surface, the air pressure would soon crush you!

Venus is undoubtedly possessed a strange beauty of its own. Both beauty and beast, that’s Venus!
