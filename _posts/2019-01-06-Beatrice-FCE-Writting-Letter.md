Dear Ms Evans,

I wish to apply for summer tourist guide at Information Office, as advertised in the newspaper January 6th.

I believe I can speak English farely well.  I have been communicating with British and American people on Saturday and Sundays. I can assume you we can have a lively talk together.

The other reason is I like meeting new  people and showing them around Nanjing, my town. I can promise you, Ms Evans, the people often like my talking. The History of Nanjing I can say with fluency and also let people ask questions. I would ask them if they can understand it all.

Can I ask more about the salary? Would it be large or small. Would it dependon the Tours I had given?

I hope this information will be sufficient for you to consider my application. If you need further details, please do not hesitate to contact me. For an interview I could make myself available at any time.

I look forward to hearing from you.

Yours sincerely,

Julie Davenport
