Dear sir,
  
  I noticed this advertisement about working in a holiday club for English speaking children in our yesterday's local newspaper and I think I might be qualified for this job as a volunteer.

  I have a wonderful experience of working with children because in the present, I am constantly helping out at our local kindergarten. The children and teachers all like me because I tell wonderful stories and I am a great teacher.

  My knowledge of English I cannot say is the best, but is better than most people of my age.{I dare not to say that my knowledge of English is the best, but it must be better than most people in my age.} I have attended many competitions about the English language and have always won prizes.

  And also, I would be suitable for the job because I am patient and fun, I can teach the children enjoyable English games and word puzzles to get their attentions. I can always tell them a joke or two to cheer them up when they are under the weather.

  I hope you can give me this job,if so, I will be very geateful.

Yours sincerely,

X-woman
