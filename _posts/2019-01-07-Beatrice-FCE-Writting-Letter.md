Hi Ronnie,

I'm so glad to hear from you! I think it would be great to spend the holiday with you guys.

August would be a better month to come, because I must practise piano all July. I hope it's no trouble.

As for the accommodation, I prefer your apartment because you would be staying there also. But I think they all sound good and could suit me very well.

I'm thinking that maybe we can swim or play polo. It would also be fun to surf, walk on the beach, and collect shells. Wouldn't it be wonderful to have an shell collection by the end of the summer holidays?

I'd like to visit other places, too. Are there any famous or beautiful buildings near where we are staying? I could take some great photos with you.

Do you know the weather there? Is it hot or cold?

Write soon, miss you very much!

Best wishes,

Julie
